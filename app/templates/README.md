# Vote with no paper

__Use-case:__
At a open doors day, you want people to vote for the best bridge, then you will do a ballot box, and papers that you will have to read after.

Now, you will use this software and spend only two or three minutes, to configure and read the voting system.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/cedced19/vote-nopaper/releases/latest)

3. Execute `vote-nopaper.exe`

Because we don't say it enough: thanks you all my friends to help me (by ideas or moral support) to create all software I make everyday.
